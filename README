GitFeeds.com
============

This is the source to GitFeeds, a Rails app which provides a configurable RSS
interface to any Git repository. Unlike the few other Git-to-RSS solutions which
I could find, GitFeed allows users to filter their feeds to show only the events
which are interesting.

One day, GitHub will increase the granularity of their Follow feature and render
this project obsolete. Currently, it is far too noisy to be useful (to me).


Example Feeds
-------------

* Every commit
* Commits batched by day/week
* Changes to a specific path
* New releases (tags)
* Stable releases (non-beta/rc tags)
* Commits which close a GitHub issue

NOTE: None of these actually work yet!
